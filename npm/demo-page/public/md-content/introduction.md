# Introduction

As the automotive industry is in a deep stage of transformation. Not only the challenges by high requirements for circular economy but also the new opportunities by big efforts in digitalization demand for safe & secure soltions for data exchange. Furthermore there are political and legal requirements to any data-exchange between different parties in the automotive valuechain.

To anwser all requirements there is a high need of technologies that could enable the opportunities and increase research & development speed but also ensure that legal and political requirements are fulfilled. 

For this we are doing research on two major topics. On the one hand we are researching Privacy Enhancing Technologies which enable data providers to anonymize & transform data that it could fulfill the requirements. At the other hand we are researching and demonstrating the application of Federated Machine Learning. This methodology allows to train a model for a specific use-case on data without seeing and transfering the data. Using that method enables to train and achieve models based on data of different providers without the risk of data leaks.
