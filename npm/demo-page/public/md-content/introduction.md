# Introduction

Catena-X intends to be nothing less than "the first open and collaborative data ecosystem". To this end the Catena-X architecture is designed to provide the necessary roles, interfaces and processes in order to realize "the first data-driven value chain incorporating all participants and steps". While there is no doubt about the potential benefits, data sovereignty is crucial to make sure that every participant's privacy requirements, intellectual property and legal obligations are considered and protected for the whole lifetime of data and information. [Data sharing](#the-copy-problem) obviously is the easiest part and concepts for [access control](https://confluence.catena-x.net/display/PL/Identity+Access+Management) or [policy tracking](https://confluence.catena-x.net/display/ARTI/Usage+Policies+in+Catena-X%3A+Implementing+XACML) are being developed. However, all of these solutions and processes need to handle the actual data and thus require signicificant data protection efforts. 

The Emergig Technologies Team is located in the Forward-Thinking Organisation of the Catena-X consortia. Funded from the TP 3 AP 7. The objective of the Emerging Technologies Team is to evaluate technologies that allow compute on data or extract information from data without accessing or seeing the actual data. Such concepts can reduce the risks of data breaches or malicious behavior and even enable new use cases that have been deemed categorically impossible due to strict confidentiality requirements. To this end the following key areas / technologies are handled in our team and introduced on this page: 

* Privacy Preserving Technologies (PPT/PET)
* Federated Machine Learning (FML) / Federated Artificial Intelligence (FAI)
* Multi Party Computation (MPC)

This website elaborates on the privacy risks of an open data ecosystem and how the above mentioned technologies could be applied to mitigate such risks. The content on the following pages is aimed at product owners, business owners or architects to provide fundamental information for risk assessment and decision making and is not providing ready-to-use concepts or solutions. As will be shown, concrete implementation is very depending on the actual use case and thorough analysis on a case-by-case level is inevitable.
