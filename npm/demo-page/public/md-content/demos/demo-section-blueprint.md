## Example: <xxx>

<!---
Textual, not implemented 

* What is the scenario for the example? (high level use case)
** Short story, practical, not too abstract
** What are the roles?
** What is the setup? (architecture, assumptions, etc.)

* How does the example work?
(stepwise description encouraged, e.g., 1. Alice says "Hi" 2. Bob turns around and runs off ...)
** What inputs do users provide?
** What happens?
** What are the results?
** OPTIONAL: If not obvious: What results / side effects are avoided by the use of the technology?
